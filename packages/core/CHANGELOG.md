# @urql/core

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Adds the `maskTypename` export to urql-core, this deeply masks typenames from the given payload.
  Masking `__typename` properties is also available as a `maskTypename` option on the `Client`. Setting this to true will
  strip typenames from results, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#533](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/533))
- Add support for sending queries using GET instead of POST method (See [#519](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/519))
- Add client.readQuery method (See [#518](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/518))

- Add explicit error when creating Client without a URL in development. (See [#512](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/512))
